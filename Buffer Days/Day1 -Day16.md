Today I revised all the major DSA patterns and problems solved from Day 1 to Day 16 to strengthen concepts and improve recall speed.

## Prefix Sum & Prefix + HashMap

### Key Idea

Use cumulative sums to answer subarray and range queries efficiently.

### What I Revised

* Range Sum Query
* Running Sum
* Subarray Sum Equals K
* Subarrays Divisible by K
* Contiguous Array

### Learning

Prefix difference logic and hashmap usage help solve subarray problems in linear time.

## Two Pointers (Left – Right)

### Key Idea

Use pointers from both ends of a sorted or boundary-based array to satisfy conditions.

### What I Revised

* Two Sum II
* 3Sum
* Container With Most Water
* Boats to Save People
* Minimize Maximum Pair Sum
* Sum of Square Numbers
* Heaters
* Next Permutation

### Learning

Move pointers based on comparison and constraints to reduce unnecessary checks.

---

## Reversing & Swapping Patterns

### Key Idea

Use two pointers to reverse or selectively swap elements.

### What I Revised

* Reverse String
* Reverse Vowels
* Reverse Only Letters
* Valid Palindrome
* Valid Palindrome II
* Squares of Sorted Array

### Learning

Skipping conditions and controlled swapping are common in string and array problems.

---

## In-place Array & String Processing

### Key Idea

Use read and write pointers to modify arrays without extra space.

### What I Revised

* Remove Element
* Remove Duplicates
* String Compression (443)

### Learning

Overwrite unwanted values instead of using additional memory.

## Sliding Window

### Fixed Window

* Maximum Average Subarray (643)

### Variable Window

* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (3)

### Condition-based Window

* Subarrays With Bounded Maximum (795)

### Learning

Sliding window helps process subarrays and substrings efficiently using dynamic window sizes.

---

## Merging Sorted Arrays

### Key Idea

Compare two sorted arrays using two pointers.

### What I Revised

* Merge Sorted Array (88)
* Distance Value Between Two Arrays (1385)
* Heaters (475)

### Learning

Sorted order allows efficient merging and nearest-value searching.

## Linked List Pointer Techniques

### Key Patterns

* Slow & Fast pointers
* Pointer switching
* Circular linking

### What I Revised

* Linked List Cycle (141)
* Linked List Cycle II (142)
* Remove Nth Node From End (19)
* Rotate List (61)
* Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### Learning

Pointer movement and redirection are powerful for linked list problems.

## Overall Learning from Day 1 to Day 16

* Built strong foundation in pointer-based problem solving
* Understood multiple variations of two-pointer patterns
* Improved efficiency by avoiding brute force approaches
* Strengthened logic-based thinking instead of memorization

## Revision Goal

This buffer day helped consolidate concepts, improve speed, and prepare for advanced patterns ahead.
