### Two Pointers – String Problems (Today)

Today I practiced basic string problems using the **two-pointer technique** to strengthen my understanding of pointer movement and conditions.

---

### Valid Palindrome

**Logic:**

* Use two pointers, one from the start and one from the end
* Skip non-alphanumeric characters
* Compare characters ignoring case
* If characters mismatch, it is not a palindrome
* Move both pointers inward until they cross

**Why it works:**
A palindrome reads the same from both ends, so comparing characters from left and right is sufficient.

### Reverse a String

**Logic:**

* Place one pointer at the start and one at the end
* Swap characters at both pointers
* Move pointers inward until they meet

**Why it works:**
Each swap puts characters into their correct reversed positions.

### Key Learning

* Two pointers are useful for string problems
* Pointer movement depends on conditions
* These problems build a strong base for advanced two-pointer questions

### Problems Solved

* Valid Palindrome
* Reverse a String
